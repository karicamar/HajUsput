# Technologies Used
I tried to follow SOLID principles, align it with clean architecture(clean code practices, design patterns, generic programming and inheritance), enabling easier updates, better testing, and more maintainable code in the long run.

Some of the technologies and packages used: 
- **C#**: ASP.NET Core Web API
- **Flutter**: Cross-platform UI development
- **RabbitMQ + Google SMTP**:
  - Producer: Publishes email tasks (e.g., user registration) to a RabbitMQ queue.
  - Consumer: Listens to the queue, processes tasks, and sends emails via Google SMTP.
- **Microsoft SQL Server**: for Database Management and storing application data
- **Entity Framework**: for Data Management
- **Hangfire**: for Background Jobs
- **Google Maps Platform**: Maps SDK, Routes API & Directions API
- **Basic Authentication & Authorization**: the backend uses C# for handling auth.
- **AutoMapper & Autofac Integration**: for Object Mapping & DI Management
- **ML.NET Price Prediction**: a machine learning model for price prediction
- **Stripe**: for the Mobile Payment system
- **Docker**: for containerization of the API, SQL database, and RabbitMQ
- **iTextSharp**: for generating PDF reports (financial, payment summaries, etc.)
